# Stremio Cast

## Abstract protocol over HTTP for communicating with a media player

### Use cases:

* Casting / remote control (Chromecast-style) to a DIY media center
* Unified interface to different casting protocols (Chromecast, DLNA, Airplay)
* Simple, easy to understand and implement alternative to complex protocols like castv2 or DLNA

--------

**DISCLAIMER** This does not pretend to be an alternative of existing protocols, such as DLNA and castv2. It's merely something similar designed with extreme simplicity in mind over HTTP and JSON.
